      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A computer <del>geek</del> enthusiast since the days when RAM was measured in KB, I&#39;ve spent most of my career working in IT support, but when, in Autumn 2017, I found myself with the opportunity to attend Flatiron School&#39;s web development immersive, I decided it was time for a recalibration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, with a head full of web dev knowledge, over a decade of professional experience in tech, and a lifetime spent solving puzzles, shooting troubles, and taking things apart to figure out how they work (they <i>usually</i> still work when I put them back together), I&#39;m currently seeking opportunities/challlenges/creative fulfillment.
      </p>

        Interested in working with me? <a href="mailto:krandles@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get in touch</a> and let&#39;s build something incredible.
