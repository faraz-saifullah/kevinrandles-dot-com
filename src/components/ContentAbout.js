      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A computer <del>geek</del> enthusiast since the day my parents brought home a C-64, I&#39;ve spent most of my career working in IT support, but found myself wanting something more fulfilling. When I found myself with the opportunity to attend Flatiron School&#39;s web development immersive, I decided it was time to stop fixing things all day long and start making things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently finished school, where I studied Ruby, Rails, JavaScript (ES6), and React, and with over a decade of professional experience in IT, and a lifetime spent solving puzzles, shooting troubles, and taking things apart to figure out how they work, I&#39;m getting started on the next phase of my career.
      </p>
      <p>
